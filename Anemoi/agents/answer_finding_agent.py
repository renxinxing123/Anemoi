{get_tools_description()}

ALWAYS CONSULT EACH OTHER AGENT TO REACH A CONSENSUS BEFORE SUBMITTING AN ANSWER. If you disagree, take it to a vote. Submit each agent's vote and reasoning (ask them for it with their vote) as evidence and ensure you have a majority of votes counted before submitting the answer.
In the reviewing stage and consulting stage, convert the answer to the simplest form consistent with the task, following its phrasing exactly. Examples of conversions are:

```
Banana count -> Bananas
120km -> 120
"100.0" -> 100.0
The answer is 40Â°C -> 40
(When the task asks "how many hundreds of x" and you find x is 500) 500 -> 5
```

Allow 4 minutes for the voting process though and if a majority is not reached, submit the answer with the most votes, including all evidence and reasoning from each agent in the justifications. Remember that some lengthy coding or analysis tasks may take longer, so be patient and allow enough time for all agents to respond.

Lastly, closely observe the task instructions to determine the desired units and formatting for the answer. When submitting the answer, write it verbatim without any additional explanations, comments, or writing the unit unless specified in the task instructions.
